##  Motivation
This is a 2nd version of a program I had already written, but since this is a complete re-write and very different I am releasing this as its' own project.

I wanted something to help me quickly change my system volume very quickly without barely having to move my hands and I wanted it to be portable for my various machines and this is what I wrote.  

## Installation
Portable program (Plans for installer and portable option).
## Test
I have tested on Windows 10 64 Bit
